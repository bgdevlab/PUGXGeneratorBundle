This bundle is an extension of [SensioGeneratorBundle](https://github.com/sensio/SensioGeneratorBundle).

It adds many functionality on top of it, and corrects some minor issues:
* pages with layout (main block name is customizable)
* forms in correct namespace (under Type, not under Form)
* @ParamConverter in actions
* different format for dates/times/datetimes
* include relation fields in show and index templates
* shorter form names
* real entity names instead of "$entity" in actions and templates
* translated texts
* support for form themes (customizable)
* default templates suitable with Boostrap and Font Awesome
* nice "check" icons for boolean fields (when using Font Awesome)
* support for pagination (requires [KnpPaginatorBundle](https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpPaginatorBundle))
* (still experimental) support for filters (requires [LexikFormFilterBundle](https://github.com/lexik/LexikFormFilterBundle))
* (still experimental) support for sorting

When reporting a bug, it may be a good idea to reproduce it in a basic project

and following some steps.
