============

When reporting a bug, it may be a good idea to reproduce it in a basic project built
using the Symfony Standard Edition with PUGXGeneratorBundle installed, to allow 
bundle developers reproducing the issue by simply cloning it and following some steps.

[PUGXGeneratorBundleSandbox](https://github.com/garak/PUGXGeneratorBundleSandbox) could be
a good start point.

For a Pull Request, please follow coding standards.
A good tool to ensure standards is [PHP-CS-Fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/).
